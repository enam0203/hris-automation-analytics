# Automated People Operations Platform

This project simulates a modern People Operations and HRIS-style platform that integrates
employee lifecycle management, workflow automation, compliance tracking, and workforce analytics.

The goal is to demonstrate end-to-end systems thinking across HR, data, and automation.
Mirroring how internal People Ops and HRIS teams design and operate real infrastructure.

This repository will incrementally evolve to include:
- A mock HRIS data model
- Automated lifecycle and compliance workflows
- Workforce analytics and attrition modeling
- Executive-facing dashboards

This is a portfolio project designed to reflect real-world People Operations systems
